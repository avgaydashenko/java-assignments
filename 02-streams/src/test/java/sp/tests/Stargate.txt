In 2011, Stargate Universe, the last Stargate program on television, ended its run and the franchise has been in limbo since.
Brad Wright announced that there were no more plans to continue the same story in further productions.
The predominant story arc thus ran for 17 years and includes 17 seasons (354 episodes) of programming.
However, a variety of other media either ignore this main story arc, or reset it, while maintaining essential elements that define the franchise (mainly, the inclusion of a Stargate device).
These include the 2002 animated series Stargate Infinity, and a possible new film series once again directed by Roland Emmerich, announced as being under consideration in 2014.
